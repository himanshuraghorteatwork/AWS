Here’s a clean, professional LinkedIn post draft you can share, summarizing your notes on AWS Lambda and Java deployment in a way that’s beginner-friendly yet shows practical steps:

🚀 Exploring AWS Lambda with Java ☕✨
Recently, I’ve been learning about AWS Lambda and how it helps achieve serverless computing – a powerful way to run applications without worrying about managing servers.

Here’s what I learned and tried out 👇

✅ What is AWS Lambda?

It's based on the Function as a Service (FaaS) model.

Automatically scales up or down based on your workload.

Follows a Pay as you use billing model – you only pay when your code runs.

No bill if there’s no traffic to your application! 💸

⚙️ Running Java Code with AWS Lambda
I deployed a simple Java function using AWS Lambda (Java 21 runtime):

1️⃣ Create Lambda Function

Choose runtime: Java 21

Enable Function URL → Auth Type: None (public access)

📍 This gives a URL you can directly call to trigger your Lambda.

2️⃣ Upload the JAR

Used Maven/Gradle to build my JAR, or downloaded from
👉 https://github.com/himanshuraghorteatwork/AWS

3️⃣ Configure the Handler
Handler syntax:

bash
Copy
Edit
className::methodName
For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
in.ashokit.LambdaHandler::handleRequest
4️⃣ Test the function

Simply hit the Function URL in the browser or using tools like Postman and see the response.

💡 Key takeaway:
AWS Lambda makes it incredibly simple to deploy Java code in a truly serverless way, letting us focus on writing business logic instead of managing infrastructure.

🛠️ If you're starting with AWS Lambda (or serverless in general), I'd highly recommend trying this small project — it’s a great hands-on intro! 🌱
